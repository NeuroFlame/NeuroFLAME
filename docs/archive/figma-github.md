### Using Figma with GitHub for UI/UX

**1. Figma for Iterative Design:**
   - Figma will be the primary tool for creating and iterating on designs.
   - Designers and team members collaborate using Figmaâ€™s commenting and versioning features for real-time feedback and updates.
   - Discussions, reviews, and revisions take place within Figma until the design is ready for approval.

**2. Approval Process:**
   - Once a design is finalized in Figma, it goes through an internal approval process.
   - Approval is signaled via comments or team sign-off within Figma.

**3. Storing Final Design Snapshots in GitHub:**
   - After approval, export the finalized design from Figma as an image file (e.g., `.png`, `.svg`).
   - Store these design snapshots in a designated `designs` folder within GitHub.
   - Use meaningful commit messages to track versions and changes (e.g., "Added final design for feature X").

**4. Linking Figma to GitHub:**
   - In pull requests (PRs) and documentation, include links to the live Figma files for reference to ongoing designs.
   - GitHub serves as the single source of truth for approved designs, while Figma is used for live, ongoing design work.

**5. Centralized Documentation:**
   - Alongside the design snapshots, document key design decisions in Markdown files stored in GitHub.
   - Ensure all final design files and decision logs are stored and versioned in GitHub to provide a clear, traceable history.



**UI/UX Design and Discussion Processes**

To make COINSTAC reliable, easy to work on, easy to use, and sustainable, we propose the following processes:

### UI/UX Design Workflow:
- **Design, Discussion, Approval**: Discuss and approve UI/UX designs before implementation to ensure quality.
- **Tools**:
  - **GitHub Discussions**: For adding new items, discussing their relevance, proposing solutions, and making decisions before implementation.
  - **Figma**: For design collaboration with version control.
  - **Key Design Snapshots**: Document approved designs in the GitHub repository for reference.
  - **RFCs**: Use RFCs for formal proposals when needed.
