When it comes to UI/UX design and implementation, as well as the broader software system, we want to develop and use processes that result in COINSTAC being:
- Reliable
- Easy to work on
- Easy to use
- Sustainable over the long term

### Goals
- **Deliberate, high-quality**:
	- Design
	- Code
	- Decision-making

- **Alignment and coherence**:
	- Across all team members, current and future
	- Between design and TReNDS Center's goals
	- Across layers of abstraction, from high-level concepts down to implementation

### Areas of focus:
- Quality control
- Centralized documentation
